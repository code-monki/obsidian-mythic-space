# Xin

![[xin.png|left|128]]

The Xin are a delicate species of insect-like humanoids with large heads and eyes. The Xin deny ever having sent research ships to Earth in the mid-20th century, though their resemblance to the stereotypical ‘grey’ alien from that time period is uncanny. The Xin evolved from hive insects, similar to ants or bees, and most of the individuals found outside of their homeworld are sterile females. Many of them have natural telepathy, though this often atrophies the farther away a Xin gets from their hive.
