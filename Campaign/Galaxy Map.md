## Major Factions

Known space is dominated by four major factions The Alliance ([[Humans]], [[Kathir]], [[Irumai]], [[Synths]], [[Xin]]), the Brachinid Consortium ([[Brachinids]]), the Empire of Man ([[Humans]]), and the Singularity. Figure 1 illustrates the current known borders although exact borders frequently shift.

## Minor Factions
Other factions, such as the Nemesis Blight and the Cult will randomly appear but do not have fixed borders, per se.

Pirate clans and Colonial Exports Megacorporation do not have borders.
