## Major Factions

Known space is dominated by four major factions The Alliance ([[Humans]], [[Kathir]], [[Irumai]], [[Synths]], [[Xin]]), the Brachinid Consortium ([[Brachinids]]), the Empire of Man ([[Humans]]), and the Singularity. Figure 1 illustrates the current known borders although exact borders frequently shift.

## Minor Factions
Other factions, such as the Nemesis Blight and the Cult of Izanami will randomly appear but do not have fixed borders, per se.

Pirate clans and [[Colonial Exports]] Megacorporation do not have borders.
