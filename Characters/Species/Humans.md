**Humans** are the most populous species in the Alliance, making up nearly 40% of its population. Humanity was instrumental in bringing the other Alliance species together to defeat the Nemesis Blight, and have traditionally been viewed as its de facto leaders. Internal divisions and strife over the last few decades as well as psy-ops from a number of hostile powers have exposed rifts between the cultures of the various human colonies. The other Alliance species have begun to question humanity’s place at the top, and it may only be a matter of time before the Alliance fractures under its own weight.
