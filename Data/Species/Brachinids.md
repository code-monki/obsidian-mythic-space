# Brachinids

![[brachinids.png|left|128]]

**Brachinids** are a species of large intelligent decapods. They have delicate appendages capable of fine manipulation on eight of their legs, and two large crushing claws on the other two. Brachinids within Alliance space are usually missing the large claws, called War Claws, due to being escaped slaves. The Brachinid Consortium is a megacorporation that rules most of Brachinid space, and is hostile to the Alliance due to their policies of raiding and slavery. Only the Warrior Caste and Owner Caste are permitted to keep their War Claws - they are a symbol of being allowed to carry weapons and train for battle, a privilege slaves are never allowed.
