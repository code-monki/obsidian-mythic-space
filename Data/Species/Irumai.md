The **Irumai** are a mono-gendered species of humanoid plants whose skin are various shades of blue, green, or lavender. They have flowers and vines in place of hair. While they gain some nourishment from photosynthesis, they need to eat meat to survive. They can also eat vegetables, but there is some debate among Irumai society about the ethics of doing so (much like human vegans). They often find the concept of gender to be puzzling, but their society is highly stratified in other ways. Irumai are long-lived, often living for over 500 years. They can communicate through scent, and some organic creatures find their pheromones to be hypnotic.
