The Kathir are a tall mammalian species, averaging over 220 cm in height and weighing over 150 kg. They are covered in soft hair which they keep in elaborate braids to show their status and have powerful features as they evolved from pack predators not unlike Earth’s wolves or lions.

Despite coming into conflict early on after humans first discovered the Jump Gates, humans and the Kathir have the easiest time getting along of the Alliance member species, probably since both species share resemblances to animals the other traditionally kept as pets (humans think the Kathir look kinda like cats or dogs, the Kathir think humans look like ‘Thrynn,’ a primate-like social animal they have domesticated for thousands of years).
